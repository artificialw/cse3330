## Navigation
There were two major projects that were assigned to groups to complete throughout the semester. Both of these projects included guidelines that were completed and comprised of:
- Project 1 (Railway Reservation System): We were assigned to design a system that provides information to passengers about the trains available on the bases of source and destination. In the Project 1 folder, the folder consists of files such as a ER diagram, SQL queries, CREATE/INSERT statements, screenshots, and a report that includes the previous entities mentioned.
- Project 2 (Library Management System Database): We were assigned to design and implement a database for a library management system. This project included 3 phases that were split throughout the semester:
  - Part 1 (ER schema diagram): A report that includes documentation of our ER diagram, assumptions, mini-worlds, relational database schema and mapping explanations/cardinality.
  - Part 2 (implementing into SQL): A report that includes documentation of our CREATE/INSERT statements, SQL queries, and screenshots.
  - Part 3 (Queries/GUI application): A report that includes documentation of complex SQL queries, Python code for our GUI application that is used to complete certain tasks made by the user, and screenshots.
